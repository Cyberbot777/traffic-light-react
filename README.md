# Traffic Light React Project

An interactive, auto-cycling traffic light built with React and styled to resemble a real street light.  
This project was created as part of a 4Geeks Academy assignment to demonstrate understanding of React hooks and dynamic component styling.

## Features

- Realistic vertical traffic light layout with pole
- Lights cycle automatically: **green â†’ yellow â†’ red** every 1.5 seconds
- Only one light is active (glowing) at a time
- Clickable lights for manual control
- State-driven glow effect using conditional class logic

## Tech Stack

- React (via Vite)
- JavaScript
- CSS (inline + global)
- Vercel (for deployment)

## Learning Goals

- Use `useState` to manage component state
- Use `useEffect` with `setInterval` for auto-cycling behavior
- Apply conditional class names based on current state
- Style components to match real-world visuals (traffic light + pole)
- Deploy React projects with Vercel
